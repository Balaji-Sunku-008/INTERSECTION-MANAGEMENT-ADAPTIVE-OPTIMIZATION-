# INTERSECTION-MANAGEMENT-ADAPTIVE-OPTIMIZATION-

Managing traffic at busy intersections in metro cities has become a significant challenge, 
resulting in frustrating delays and increased pollution. Traditional fixed-timing traffic signals are 
no longer adequate to handle the complexities and variability of modern urban traffic flows. 
This project aims to leverage machine learning to create an intelligent traffic management 
system that dynamically adjusts signal timings based on real-time vehicle data. By employing 
advanced computer vision techniques to detect and analyse vehicle density, this system not 
only reduces congestion but also lessens the burden on traffic police, providing a more efficient 
and responsive traffic control mechanism. 
The primary objective of this project is to enhance traffic flow and minimize wait times at 
intersections in metro cities by implementing a machine learning-driven system that optimizes 
traffic signal timings based on real-time vehicle counts. This approach has proven effective in 
various studies and offers a scalable solution to urban traffic challenges. Additionally, the 
system's adaptability ensures that traffic signals respond dynamically to current conditions, 
supporting environmental goals by reducing vehicle idling and emissions. By easing the 
workload of traffic enforcement agencies, the intelligent traffic management system allows 
them to focus on more strategic tasks, contributing to a smoother and more efficient urban 
transportation infrastructure.
